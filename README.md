# Incoming Network Traffic Entropy Calculation in an SDN environment to differentiate DDoS attacks and Flash Crowds

This repo contains the code for the project done and submitted as part of course _**CS6611 - Creative & Innovative Project**_ and partial requirement for the degree of _**Bachelors of Engineering(Computer Science & Engineering)**._

_This project deals with the real-time incoming traffic classification into DDoS(Distributed Denial of Services) Attacks & Flash Crowds based on Source and Traffic Cluster Entropy Score in Software-Defined Networking(SDN) environment._

**Included in this repo: Network Simulation Scripts, Traffic Generation Scripts, Traffic Captuting & Entropy Calculation & Classification Scripts.**


**Salient Features:**
1. Real-Time Classification of incoming traffic.
2. Uses Source and Traffic Cluster Entropy.
3. Focus on reduncing the load on SDN Controller.
